A browser extension to block all visually displayed likers of a tweet.

Inspired by [Mario Sixtus (@sixtus)](https://twitter.com/sixtus):

> In Ãœbrigen wÃ¼nsche ich mir fÃ¼r solche FÃ¤lle ein Twitter-Add-On, das alle Liker eines bestimmten Tweets blockt, weil es nur ArschlÃ¶cher sein kÃ¶nnen. Wer programmiert es?

## Known Issues and ToDos

---

**NOTE:**
The Extension is currently in beta status. This means that it can not be considered as stable and there may be bugs. See [Issues](https://github.com/dmstern/likers-blocker/issues).

If you find a bug or want to suggest new features, [file a new issue](https://github.com/dmstern/likers-blocker/issues/new).

### Constraints

* For big lists of likers (hundrets and more), not *all* likers are blocked, because they do not appear in the likers list from twitter.
* Currently the extension is not available in the Chrome Web Store. You will have to install it manually.
* For some users this manual installtion does not work, because Chrome won't enable an extension that does not come from the Web Store. A workaround can be found here: https://www.ghacks.net/2017/07/04/hide-chromes-disable-developer-mode-extensions-warning/
* Currently we support only Google Chrome. Support for Firefox is [planned](https://github.com/dmstern/likers-blocker/issues/1).
